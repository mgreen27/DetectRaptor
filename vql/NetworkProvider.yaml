    Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries 
    (DLLs) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. 
    Network provider DLLs allow Windows to interface with specific network 
    protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions.
    
    This artifact enumerates NetworkProvider ProviderPath registry key entries 
    and enriches DLLPath for triage assitance. If there are rows generated we also 
    enumerate the ProviderOrder key.
    
    NOTE: By default we exclude common providers with validated authenticode. 
    In some rare cases there may be issues enriching results, check for hash value.
    
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order\ProviderOrder`
    - Specifies the order in which software-based network providers are accessed 
    by Windows when connecting or enumerating network resources.
    
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\HWOrder\ProviderOrder` 
    - Specifies the order for hardware-based network providers. This can include 
    network resources managed by specific hardware adapters or hardware-optimized network connections.
    
    HWOrder\ProviderOrder Often mirrors the software provider order but may 
    include specialized or hardware-specific providers, depending on installed 
    hardware or network devices.
